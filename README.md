# ClassroomWidgets

ClassroomWidgets is a collection of interactive HTML buttons and widgets designed to enhance classroom engagement and facilitate teaching through technology. These tools are simple to use and customizable, aiming to create dynamic and interactive learning experiences for students and educators.

## Features

- Interactive buttons for classroom activities
- Easily customizable HTML widgets
- Supports active learning and student engagement
- Can be integrated into various educational platforms
- Available for testing directly on my personal website

## Getting Started

To use these widgets in your classroom, simply clone this repository and start using the HTML code for the buttons and interactive elements. You can modify the code as needed to suit your educational environment.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of HTML and CSS
- A web browser to test and use the widgets

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fschaitel/ClassroomWidgets.git

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the interactive widgets in action.
3. Customize the HTML code as needed for your specific classroom activities.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of what you can do with these widgets:

Interactive Buttons: Create buttons for quizzes, flashcards, or navigation within lessons.

Activity Widgets: Use buttons to trigger specific classroom activities or display important messages.

Feedback Tools: Implement simple feedback mechanisms, such as thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons.

## Customizing the Widgets

You can easily customize the widgets by editing the HTML and CSS. For example, to change the text on a button, simply edit the HTML code like this:

<button class="interactive-btn">New Button Text</button>

You can also modify the button's style by adjusting the style.css file:

.interactive-btn {
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Change button color */
  color: white;              /* Change button text color */
  padding: 15px 32px;        /* Adjust button size */
}

This allows you to create your own custom widgets to suit your classroom activities.

## Test Online

You can also test these interactive widgets directly on my personal website [here](https://www.schaitel.com.br). This allows you to experience how the widgets work in a real classroom setting before implementing them yourself.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure of the widgets.
- CSS: For styling the widgets.
- JavaScript (if applicable): For adding interactivity to the widgets.

You can explore each technology and learn how they work together to create interactive classroom tools.
